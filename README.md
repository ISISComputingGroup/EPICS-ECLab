# EPICS driver for BioLogic EC-LAB potentiostats (SP-300 etc.)

You will need a copy of the EC-Lab OEM Development package from http://www.bio-logic.info/potentiostat-electrochemistry-ec-lab/software/oem-package/ to build and use this software
The ECLABSDK macro in the Makefile will then need to point to this root

Beside EPICS BASE, the ASYN module is also needed and its location must be added to configure/RELEASE
 
Note: this driver is still in development, contact freddie.akeroyd@stfc.ac.uk for further details
