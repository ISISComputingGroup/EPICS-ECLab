# EPICS driver for BioLogic EC-LAB potentiostats (SP-300, SP-240 etc.)

You will need a copy of the EC-Lab OEM Development package from http://www.bio-logic.info/potentiostat-electrochemistry-ec-lab/software/oem-package/ to build and use this software
The ECLABSDK macro in the Makefile will then need to point to this root

Beside EPICS BASE, the ASYN module is also needed and its location must be added to configure/RELEASE
